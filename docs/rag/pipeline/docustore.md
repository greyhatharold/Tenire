# Document Store System

## Overview
I have designed the Document Store system to serve as the foundational cornerstone of my RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline, providing a sophisticated multi-modal search and storage solution specifically engineered for betting and gambling data analysis. By seamlessly integrating FAISS for high-dimensional vector storage with custom-tuned TF-IDF implementations for semantic text search, I deliver a robust and efficient document management infrastructure that forms the backbone of my larger data processing ecosystem.

## Core Architecture

### Vector Storage Layer
The vector storage layer leverages advanced indexing techniques to enable rapid similarity search across high-dimensional betting data representations.

#### FAISS Integration
- **IVF (Inverted File) Index Architecture**
  - Implements a hierarchical indexing structure optimized for rapid similarity search across high-dimensional vectors
  - Dynamically adjusts clustering parameters based on data distribution patterns
  - Supports both exact and approximate nearest neighbor search with configurable trade-offs
  - Maintains separate indexes for different betting data categories when beneficial

#### Hardware Acceleration
- **Apple Silicon Optimization**
  - Leverages Metal Performance Shaders for accelerated vector operations on M1/M2/M3/M4 architectures
  - Implements custom memory management strategies to maximize Neural Engine utilization
  - Dynamically adjusts batch sizes based on available computational resources
  - Provides fallback pathways for non-accelerated hardware environments

### Text Search Layer
The text search component provides sophisticated semantic analysis capabilities through an enhanced TF-IDF implementation.

#### Enhanced TF-IDF Implementation
- **Betting-Specific Optimizations**
  - Custom n-gram processing tailored for gambling terminology and betting patterns
