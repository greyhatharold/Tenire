## 2. System Architecture Overview

### 2.1 Core Architectural Principles

The architecture is built upon three fundamental pillars: document storage, embedding generation, and intelligent retrieval. These components work in concert to provide a robust foundation for gambling data analysis.

The Document Store serves as the central hub for data management, leveraging FAISS for high-dimensional vector storage with custom-tuned TF-IDF implementations for semantic text search. The Embeddings System provides state-of-the-art vector representations optimized for betting data characteristics, while the Retriever implements a sophisticated multi-stage pipeline with advanced reranking capabilities.

Each core component is meticulously designed to fulfill its role within the architecture. The Document Store (`@docustore.py`) employs FAISS to manage and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently, ensuring swift retrievals even as the dataset scales. Its integration with TF-IDF (`@docustore.md`) allows for precise text-based searches, enabling the system to handle both vector and textual queries seamlessly. The Embeddings System (`@embeddings.py`) generates rich vector representations that capture the intricate patterns and terminology specific to gambling data, enhancing the system's ability to understand and process complex queries. The Retriever (`@retriever.py`) orchestrates the retrieval process, utilizing a multi-stage pipeline that first performs broad searches and then refines results through advanced reranking mechanisms. This ensures that the most relevant and contextually appropriate data is surfaced, providing users with actionable insights swiftly and accurately.

   - Context assembly

The interaction between components is orchestrated through well-defined interfaces and communication protocols. When new data is added to the Document Store (`@docustore.py`), the Embeddings System (`@embeddings.py`) generates corresponding vectors, ensuring that each document is adequately represented in the high-dimensional space. Cache synchronization mechanisms are in place to maintain consistency and optimize retrieval speeds, while batch processing optimizations reduce computational overhead during bulk operations. Once queries are received, the Embeddings System translates them into vector representations tailored for the Retriever (`@retriever.py`), which applies model-specific optimizations to enhance retrieval accuracy. Performance monitoring tools track the efficiency of these processes, allowing for real-time adjustments and scalability. The Retriever then communicates back to the Document Store, initiating multi-modal search operations that consider both vector similarities and semantic relevance. Advanced reranking algorithms refine the initial search results, ensuring that the most pertinent documents are prioritized. Finally, context assembly compiles the retrieved data into coherent and actionable insights, ready for downstream analysis or user consumption.
