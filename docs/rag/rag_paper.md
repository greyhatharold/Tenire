## 1. Introduction

Modern gambling systems generate vast amounts of complex data that requires sophisticated analysis and retrieval capabilities. This paper presents a novel RAG architecture that addresses these challenges through a unified approach to document storage, embedding generation, and intelligent retrieval. The architecture, implemented in the Tenire Framework, provides a comprehensive solution for processing and analyzing gambling data while maintaining system stability and performance.

### In-Depth Explanation

The Tenire Framework serves as the backbone of this architecture, seamlessly integrating various components to handle the unique demands of gambling data analysis:

- The Document Store (`@docustore.py` and `@docustore.md`) is designed to efficiently manage large volumes of betting records, leveraging FAISS for vector storage and optimized TF-IDF for text-based searches
- The Embeddings System (`@embeddings.py` and `@embeddings.md`) is responsible for translating raw data into meaningful vector representations, utilizing models fine-tuned for the nuances of gambling terminology and patterns
