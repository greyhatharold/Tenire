# Organizers Overview

The Organizers module provides core system management and orchestration capabilities for the Tenire framework. It consists of three main components that work together to ensure proper resource management, monitoring, and timing coordination across the system.

## Components

### Compactor (Resource Management)

The Compactor serves as the centralized garbage collection and cleanup management system. It ensures proper disposal of resources and handles graceful shutdowns across the entire framework.

Key features:
- Centralized cleanup management for all system resources
- Prioritized cleanup task execution
- Both synchronous and asynchronous cleanup capabilities
- Signal-based cleanup coordination
- Resource tracking and disposal
- Integration with the event loop system

Resources managed:
- Event loops and async resources
- GUI components and processes
- Thread pools and executors
- System resources and file handles
- Browser sessions and network connections

### Monitor (System Monitoring)

The ThreadedMonitor provides real-time monitoring of system components and resources, running in a dedicated thread to avoid impacting the main application performance.

Key features:
- Real-time metrics collection
- Component-specific monitoring
- System-wide resource tracking
- Warning and error detection
- Metrics history management
- Signal-based alert system

Monitored aspects:
- Thread pool utilization
- Memory and CPU usage
- Component health status
- Queue sizes and backlogs
- Error rates and warnings

### Scheduler (Timing Orchestration)

The Scheduler module, through its Orchestrator and UniversalTimer components, manages timing and coordination across all concurrent operations in the system.

Key features:
- Adaptive timing based on system load
- Priority-based resource allocation
- Burst handling with cooldown periods
- Component-specific timing configurations
- Health-aware scheduling adjustments

Timing management for:
- Async task execution
- Data processing operations
- GUI updates and rendering
- System monitoring intervals
- Thread pool operations
- Resource semaphores

## Integration and Coordination

The three organizer components work together to provide comprehensive system management:

1. **Resource Lifecycle**:
   - Compactor tracks resource allocation
   - Monitor observes resource utilization
   - Scheduler coordinates cleanup timing

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Monitor provides system metrics
   - Scheduler adjusts timing based on load
   - Compactor manages resource cleanup

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Monitor detects issues
   - Scheduler adjusts operations
   - Compactor handles cleanup

## Best Practices

1. **Resource Management**:
   - Always register resources with the Compactor
   - Use appropriate cleanup priorities
   - Handle both sync and async cleanup

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Register critical components for monitoring
   - Set appropriate alert thresholds
   - Handle monitoring alerts appropriately

3. **Timing**:
   - Configure component-specific timing
   - Consider system load in timing configs
   - Use appropriate burst limits and cooldowns

## Error Handling

The organizers provide multiple layers of error handling:

1. **Monitor Alerts**:
   - Warning thresholds
   - Error detection
   - Alert signals

2. **Cleanup Recovery**:
   - Prioritized cleanup
   - Error retry mechanisms
   - Graceful degradation

3. **Timing Adjustments**:
   - Load-based timing
   - Cooldown periods
   - Burst protection
