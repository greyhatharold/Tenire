# Monitor

The Monitor is a sophisticated thread-based monitoring system that provides real-time insights into the health and performance of the Tenire framework. Operating in its own dedicated thread to minimize impact on application performance, it continuously tracks system metrics, component health, and resource utilization.

## Overview

The ThreadedMonitor implements a comprehensive monitoring solution that runs independently of the main application thread. By operating asynchronously, it can collect and analyze system metrics without impacting the core application performance. This design ensures continuous monitoring while maintaining system responsiveness.
