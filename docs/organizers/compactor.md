# Compactor

The Compactor is the central garbage collection system within the Tenire framework, naming inspired by my recent endeavor to watch the Wall-E movie, this component orchestrates all resource cleanup tasks. By centrally managing disposal procedures, it ensures resources are properly released and that the application undergoes a smooth, graceful shutdown. This centralization is crucial for maintaining system stability and preventing resource leaks.

## Overview

Built using the Singleton pattern, the Compactor unifies all cleanup operations across the framework. As the central coordinator, it ensures a consistent shutdown sequence by tracking resource usage, scheduling cleanup tasks, and enforcing proper disposal order. This comprehensive approach helps prevent resource leaks, ensuring the application lifecycle concludes without leaving behind unnecessary or locked resources. By acting as the central garbage system, the Compactor plays a vital role in maintaining the health and efficiency of the Tenire framework. Across threads, processes, and components, the Compactor ensures that resources are properly disposed of and that the application can gracefully shut down.

## Core Responsibilities

### Resource Management
- Tracks and manages lifecycle of system resources
- Maintains weak references to prevent memory leaks
- Coordinates cleanup of multiple resource types
- Ensures proper order of resource disposal

### Cleanup Operations
- Executes cleanup tasks with priority scheduling
- Handles both synchronous and asynchronous cleanup
- Manages cleanup task dependencies
- Provides retry mechanisms for failed cleanups

### System Integration
- Coordinates with event loop system
- Integrates with signal management
- Works with thread pools and executors
- Manages GUI component disposal

## Key Features

### Prioritized Cleanup
The Compactor implements a priority-based cleanup system where:
- Higher priority tasks are executed first
- Critical system resources are prioritized
- Dependencies between cleanup tasks are respected
- Resource constraints are considered

### Signal-Based Coordination
- Listens for cleanup request signals
- Emits cleanup status signals
- Coordinates with system components
- Provides cleanup completion notifications

### Resource Categories

1. **Event Loop Resources**
   - Event loops
   - Async tasks
   - Coroutines
   - Future objects

2. **GUI Components**
   - Windows
   - Dialogs
   - Widgets
   - Render processes

3. **System Resources**
   - File handles
   - Network connections
   - Memory allocations
   - System handles

4. **Concurrency Components**
   - Thread pools
   - Process pools
   - Task queues
   - Executors

5. **Browser Resources**
   - Browser sessions
   - Web workers
   - Network requests
   - Cache entries

## Implementation Details

### Cleanup Task Management
- Tasks are registered with metadata
- Execution order is determined by priority
- Failed tasks can be retried

## Best Practices

### Task Registration
1. Register cleanup tasks early in component lifecycle
2. Specify appropriate priorities
3. Include necessary metadata
4. Handle both success and failure cases

2. Log cleanup failures
3. Handle partial cleanup states
4. Provide fallback mechanisms

## Integration Guidelines

### Component Integration
1. Register with the Compactor during initialization
2. Provide cleanup handlers
3. Specify resource dependencies
4. Handle cleanup signals

### System Shutdown
1. Initiate cleanup through signals
2. Wait for cleanup completion
3. Handle timeout scenarios
4. Verify resource release

### Monitoring Integration
1. Track cleanup metrics
2. Monitor resource usage
3. Report cleanup status
4. Handle cleanup alerts

## Common Patterns

### Cleanup Registration
- Register during component initialization
- Include priority and dependencies
- Provide both sync and async handlers
- Include timeout handling

### Resource Tracking
- Use weak references when possible
- Track resource relationships

- Monitor memory usage

### Timing
- Consider cleanup duration
- Handle long-running cleanups
- Implement timeouts
- Manage cleanup ordering

### Resource Constraints
- Consider system load
- Handle resource limits
- Implement backoff strategies
- Monitor system state

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. Resource leaks
2. Cleanup timeouts
3. Dependency cycles
4. Failed cleanups

### Debugging
1. Enable debug logging
2. Monitor cleanup metrics
3. Track resource usage
4. Analyze cleanup patterns

### Recovery
1. Implement cleanup retries
2. Handle partial states
3. Provide manual cleanup
4. Monitor recovery status

## Security Considerations

### Resource Protection
- Validate cleanup requests
- Protect sensitive resources
- Handle unauthorized access
- Monitor cleanup operations

### Data Cleanup
- Secure data wiping
- Handle sensitive data
- Verify cleanup completion
- Audit cleanup operations
