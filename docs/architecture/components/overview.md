# Component System Overview

## Architecture Overview

The Tenire Framework implements a sophisticated component-based architecture designed for high concurrency, robust dependency management, and flexible component lifecycle handling. The system is built around several key principles:

### 1. Hierarchical Organization
- **Subgraphs**: Components are organized into logical subgraphs (e.g., Core, Data, GUI)
- **Dependency Management**: Clear dependency hierarchies between components and subgraphs
- **Initialization Order**: Controlled, priority-based initialization sequence

### 2. Component Lifecycle
- **Registration**: Components register with metadata, dependencies, and health checks
- **Initialization**: Managed by the ComponentScheduler with proper dependency resolution
- **Runtime**: Components are managed by their respective subgraphs
- **Cleanup**: Coordinated shutdown with proper cleanup order

### 3. Core Systems

#### Event Loop Manager (`event_loop_manager`)
- Central management of event loops across processes
- Thread-safe event loop access and cleanup
- Process-aware loop management
- Qt-specific event loop handling

#### Component Scheduler (`component_scheduler`)
- Manages component initialization sequence
- Handles concurrent initialization of independent components
- Implements retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Integrates with health monitoring system

#### Dependency Graph (`dependency_graph`)
- Manages component dependencies and initialization order
- Detects and prevents dependency cycles
- Tracks component states and relationships
- Enables subgraph isolation and management

#### Concurrency Manager (`concurrency_manager`)
- Coordinates all concurrent operations
- Manages thread pools and async tasks
- Handles GUI process integration
- Provides browser integration capabilities

#### Component Registry (`component_registry`)
- Central registration point for all components
- Manages component metadata and relationships
- Integrates with health monitoring
- Coordinates component cleanup

## Component Types

Components are categorized into the following types (`ComponentType`):

1. **CORE**: Essential system components (e.g., event loop, signal manager)
2. **DATA**: Data management components (e.g., caching, storage)
3. **GUI**: User interface components (e.g., windows, widgets)
4. **INTEGRATION**: External system integrations (e.g., APIs, databases)
5. **ORGANIZER**: System organization components (e.g., schedulers, monitors)
6. **PROFESSIONAL**: Professional-grade components (e.g., trading, analysis)
7. **PUBLIC_SERVICE**: Public-facing services (e.g., health monitoring, metrics)
8. **RAG**: Retrieval-augmented generation components
9. **SERVICER**: Service provider components (e.g., signal handling)
10. **STRUCTURE**: Structural components (e.g., dependency management)
11. **UTILITY**: Utility components (e.g., logging, configuration)

## Component Metadata

Each component is registered with comprehensive metadata:

```python
@dataclass
class ComponentMetadata:
    type: ComponentType              # Component category
    provides: List[str]             # Capabilities provided
    dependencies: Set[str]          # Required dependencies
    priority: int                   # Initialization priority
    health_checks: Optional[Dict]   # Health monitoring functions
    timing_config: Optional[Config] # Timing and scheduling settings
    cleanup_priority: int           # Cleanup order priority
    tags: Set[str]                 # Component categorization
    is_critical: bool              # Critical system component flag
```

## Initialization Flow

1. **Registration Phase**
   - Components register with the ComponentRegistry
   - Metadata and dependencies are validated
   - Health checks are registered

2. **Dependency Resolution**
   - DependencyGraph builds initialization order
   - Cycles are detected and prevented
   - Subgraphs are organized

3. **Initialization**
   - Critical core components initialized first
   - Parallel initialization of independent components
   - Health checks verified
   - Timing configurations applied

4. **Runtime Management**
   - Components managed by respective subgraphs
   - Health monitoring active
   - Event loops and concurrency managed

5. **Cleanup Phase**
   - Reverse priority-based cleanup
   - Resource release coordination
   - Proper shutdown sequence

## Integration Points

The component system integrates through several mechanisms:

### 1. Signal System
- Component state changes
- Health status updates
- System events
- Cross-component communication

### 2. Health Monitoring
- Component health checks
- System diagnostics
- Performance monitoring
- Automated recovery

### 3. Configuration
- Component configuration
- System settings
- Environment management
- Dynamic reconfiguration

## Best Practices

1. **Component Design**
   - Clear single responsibility
   - Explicit dependencies
   - Health check implementation
   - Proper cleanup handling

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Minimal dependencies
   - Explicit dependency declaration
   - Proper cleanup registration
   - Health check integration

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Error isolation
   - Recovery procedures
