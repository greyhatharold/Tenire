# Hospital Package Overview

## Introduction

The Hospital package is a robust solution for managing health in the Tenire framework. It provides extensive capabilities for real-time monitoring, issue detection, and automated recovery measures. By closely integrating with the dependency graph, it detects component anomalies, diagnoses problems, and preserves system stability.

## Core Architecture

### Health Coordinator

The Health Coordinator orchestrates the entire health monitoring lifecycle. It provides:

- Comprehensive management of the health monitoring lifecycle
- Orchestration of component checks with efficient scheduling and concurrency
- Processing of collected outcomes for unified system health status
- Integration with the signal system for health event synchronization

### Health Check Registry

The Registry manages the complete catalog of health checks and responses. It provides:

- Comprehensive compilation and organization of registered health checks
- Maintenance of automated response configurations
- Straightforward interface for check and response registration
- Retention of scheduling details for all system checks

### Health Check Executor

The Executor runs health checks with robust safeguards. It provides:

- Time-constrained execution preventing unbounded operations
- Orchestrated concurrent check execution with resource balancing
- Performance metrics and outcome data collection
- Historical logging of check executions

### Response Executor

The Response Executor manages automated recovery actions. It provides:

- Execution of corrective measures based on predefined conditions
- Management of scheduled attempts with cooldown enforcement
- Recording of response success rates and histories
- Implementation of structured recovery strategies

### Health Charts

The Charts module defines unified monitoring structures. It includes:

- HealthStatus: System state classification (HEALTHY, DEGRADED, UNHEALTHY, UNKNOWN)
- HealthCheckLevel: Check importance levels (CRITICAL, WARNING, INFO)
- AutoResponseAction: Recovery routine identifiers
- Standardized data structures for consistent monitoring

## Key Features
